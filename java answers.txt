Advantages of Collection Framework:
	Consistent API : The API has a basic set of interfaces like Collection, Set, List, or Map. All classes (ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, etc) that implement these interfaces have some common set of methods.
Reduces programming effort: A programmer doesn’t have to worry about the design of Collection, and he can focus on its best use in his program.
Increases program speed and quality: Increases performance by providing high-performance implementations of useful data structures and algorithms.


set: doesnt allow duplicates values,


In Java, characters are stored using Unicode conventions. Character stream is useful when we want to process text files. These text files can be processed character by character. A character size is typically 16 bits.


Byte oriented reads byte by byte.  A byte stream is suitable for processing raw data like binary files.
